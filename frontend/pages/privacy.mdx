Your privacy is critically important to us at poll-app.

*   We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
*   We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.

Below is our Privacy Policy.

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### _Information You Provide to Us_

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

*   **Basic Account Information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. This will may include your name, email, and anything else necessary for setting up your account.
*   **Transaction and Billing Information:** If you sign up for a paid plan, we require credit card information. We do not store this information ourselves and instead use stripe for all transaction processing.
*   **Poll Information:** In order to display and update your polls. All polls and voting on polls are sent to poll-app and stored as long as they are needed. 
*   **Communications with Us:** When you communicate with us via form, email, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications.

#### _Information We Collect Automatically_

We also collect some information automatically:

*   **Log Information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.
*   **Usage Information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. 
*   **Information from Cookies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.

#### _Information We Collect from Other Sources_

We may also get information about you from other sources. Most notably we will store your slack information for authenticating users and process poll requests.

### How and Why We Use Information

#### _Purposes for Using Information_

We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:

*   To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, charge you for any of our paid Services, or provide essays and stories for your reading pleasure through Longreads;
*   To further develop and improve our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;
*   To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;
*   To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of poll-app and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services;

### Sharing Information

#### _How We Share Information_

We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

*   **Third Party Vendors:** We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide our service to you or for our needs in hosting and serving content.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, poll-app may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. poll-app encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
